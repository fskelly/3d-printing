# 3D printing

I am using this repo to track my research, designs and the things I print using [issues](https://github.com/jcallaghan/3d-printing/issues). I will store my STL and GCode files in the [repo](https://github.com/jcallaghan/3d-printing) for sharing and archive purposes and use the [Wiki](https://github.com/jcallaghan/3d-printing/wiki) to capture useful information relating to my printing.

## Setup
My setup is as follows:
* Ender-5 Pro (stock)
  * Basic cable-tie cable management
  * Creality printer enclosure tent
  * Glass bed
* Raspberry Pi 4B
  * Offical Raspberry Pi Webcam (1080p)
  * OctoPrint
    * Home Assistant integration
    * Official Raspberry Pi screen with OctoPrint Touch UI.
